A script that collects data on Bitcoin, Ethereum and the market every 5 minutes from the Coinstats API. Also collects sentiment data from Alternative every hours.

You'll need to insert your API-KEY from Coinstats in ApiKey.txt . You can get one at this address :  https://openapi.coinstats.app/

The required modules have been included in requirements.txt , so to install them just :
"pip install -r requirements.txt" in your environment.

Copy the repository, install the dependencies and see the magic unfold by launching fetch.py
