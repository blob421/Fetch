Getting started
===============

Setting up your API key
-----------------------
To use Fetch, you have to get an API key. The process is pretty straightfoward
as you can easily get one at this address by creating an account:

https://openapi.coinstats.app/


Next, there is a file named ApiKey.txt in the root folder of the repository.
Open it and replace this field with your key : YOUR_API_KEY_HERE 


Required dependencies
----------------------
Required dependencies are included in requirements.txt and must be installed
in your python environment before proceeding.

With your python environment activated in the terminal:

1. cd /path/to/requirement.txt        e.g. /desktop/project
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
